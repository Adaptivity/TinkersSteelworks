============ TSteelworks buglist ============

Deep tank:
Draining a tank w/ a filter doesn't work if the fluid isn't at the bottom -- could be a ExU error

Cookiecore:
RenderHelper#DrawTextureRect should use floats instead of ints
Remove IChunkNotify

Limestone should not be smelted to limestone cobble, cobble should be smelted into limestone
Smelting smooth limestone should give 4 bricks
Bricks drop limestone dust, should drop themselves
Bricks don't break glass
