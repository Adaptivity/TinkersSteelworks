To preserve the sacred art of steelwork, we have written this book in a special invisible ink which is activated on a factor of time. This will help ensure that the people of the age have reached a level of social and technological maturity may harmoniously benefit from the knowledge contained herein.

The discovery of steel opens doors to a vast and brave new world of marvels inconceivable by the primitive cave dweller. Heed my words dear reader: attentive caution must exercised in its production. Steelworking is an art and a hallmark of the master tinkerer. Be your intentions noble and hands deft!

<text>Welcome to the world of steelwork. Within these pages you will be presented the secrets of processing metals and non-metal materials into refined substances with much more substantial traits over their mundane predecessors. Just remember, experimentation is key!

The High Oven will be your doorway into this process. It is somewhat smaller than the Smeltery you are accustomed to, yet, both the method for its construction and general operation are very similar.</text>
